## Setting up the development environment
These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- Java version 17 or later
- NodeJS
- NPM

### Setup
The website is already working on a server (https://flightoroo.hopto.org/), but can also be run locally.

Clone repository:
`git clone https://gitlab.cs.taltech.ee/heatsp/iti0302-2023-frontend.git`

Write `npm run dev` into the terminal and proceed to the localhost link you will be provided with.

To receive database data along with the locally ran frontend code, you need to run backend locally as well (project 
https://gitlab.cs.ttu.ee/heatsp/iti0302-2023-backend).
