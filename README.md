# iti-0302-2023-frontend Readme

**Team 5**

## Project description
This project contains the frontend part of team 5 website. 
In this project our team uses:
- Vue.js
- Vite

Link to gitlab: https://gitlab.cs.taltech.ee/heatsp/iti0302-2023-frontend

## Usage
The website is already working on a server (https://flightoroo.hopto.org/), but can also run locally. 
To run project locally you need to write **npm run dev** into the terminal and proceed to the localhost link you will
be provided with.

To receive database data along with the locally ran frontend code, you need to run backend locally as well (project 
https://gitlab.cs.ttu.ee/heatsp/iti0302-2023-backend).
